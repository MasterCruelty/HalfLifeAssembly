# HalfLifeAssembly
This was my project for the exam of computer architecture at University of Milan.
It's a text-based game about the first **Half Life**, precisely when **Gordon Freeman** has to escape from Black Mesa at the beginning of the game.

### Usage
It's written in MIPS 32 and you have to run it in ```QTSpim```, a simulator of this assembly code. You can download it from [here](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

### Language
The Strings used in this game are completely in Italian, so deal with it I guess.
